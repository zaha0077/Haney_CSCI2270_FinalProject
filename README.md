Summary
-------------------------------------
This code will emulate a "Jukebox." The code will read in song titles and artists from a .txt file and store the values in a hash table of structs. The code will contain functionality to add songs to the archive, delete a song from the archive, print the archive's contents, and add songs to a queue. Once a list of songs have been queued, the user can then tell the program to "play" the songs in the order they were queued, printing their title and artist.
